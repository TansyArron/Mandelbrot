Mandelbrot rendering for HackerSchool

Tansy Arron, learning math things and playing with GitHub

==========

Things I learned creating this project:

* Mirrors make great white boards.

* How to set up and use multiprocessor worker pools 

* Mandelbrot math Z = Z**2 + C

* Converting (x,y) grid coordinates into complex numbers 

* How to use pillow to render images

* How to use both RGBa and HSV color

* How to create and use a virtual environment

* Command Line Interface 
   - the up key and the tab key are my new best friends.

   - printing the run time of a program using time.

   - git diff, git add, git commit, git push.
